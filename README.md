## Retired - Please Use GitHub Discussions

To encourage broader discussion of the roadmap and community calls, we have
decided to use [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/discussions) at the
SingularityCE repository.

Please use:

 * The [Roadmap Category](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/discussions/categories/roadmap) for information and discussion about future SingularityCE releases.
 * The [Community Call category](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/discussions/categories/community-call) to find agendas, and suggest topics, for the monthly SingularityCE community calls.  
 
-----

This repository contains documents, meeting minutes, etc. for the [SingularityCE](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) user and developer community, as well as links to other spaces we use to communicate and collaborate.

We use the [singularityce team space on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/team/singularityce) to collaboratively create and edit the markdown files in this repository. This lets multiple people work on a document in real-time. Each file contains a HackMD badge - please follow the link to edit the document, rather than creating pull requests on GitHub. Changes made in HackMD will be synced to GitHub at appropriate times.


## Slack Chat and Google Group

If you have questions about SingularityCE, which aren't really bugs suitable for a GitHub issue, then you can talk to community members and developers via:

* Our Slack workspace [singularityce.slack.com](https://join.slack.com/t/singularityce/shared_invite/zt-r4wpx7wl-icxZwBMb~OAspdsMokY5Cg)
* Our Google Group https://groups.google.com/g/singularity-ce

These are the best locations to ask about how to use Singularity, or for help with application specific issues.


## Community Meetings

We hold a monthly community meeting via Zoom call. This will take place on the 1st Thursday of each month a **12 noon ET (US Eastern Time)**.

* [Zoom Link](https://zoom.us/j/98830550629?pwd=ZENYK0hUUlBoSGZlTUl2WEdEa1FDUT09)

* [iCal Calendar Link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_saforbmeq46digf278419lbh1k%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)


Each meeting will start with a 20 minute show and tell session, where community members are able to share software, workflows, cool containers created with, or integrating with, SingularityCE. This will be followed by 35 minutes for development discussion.

Please let us know if you'd like to take a show and tell slot!

### Agenda / Minutes / Recordings

* Recordings of community meetings are [posted to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SylabsInc).

## [Roadmap](roadmap.md)

The SingularityCE roadmap can be found in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) - please feel free to comment, or edit this document to suggest features or considerations for prioritizing development work.

Agreed upon roadmap items will become [GitHub issues](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues), and will eventually be assigned to a [milestone](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/milestones) once the scope is known, and we understand who has time to work on them and when.

The SingularityCE project is hosted in Sylabs' GitHub space, and we work to take care of the day-to-day maintenance, but we'd love you to get involved! Please reach out to us on Slack, the Google Group, Github at any time if you are interested in taking on a task on the roadmap. You're also very welcome to submit a PR directly, but discussing it briefly first is always a good idea to avoid duplicating work.
